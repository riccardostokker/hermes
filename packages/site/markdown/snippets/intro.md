title: So, What is Hermes?

# :emerald[{{ front.title }}]

Hermes is a framework of applications, plugins etc.

At its core, it's a renderer for Markdown code with an extended syntax
(sometimes referred to as "Markdown Components" - MDC).

It supports _directives_, which allow you to embed Vue Components, text 
decorators etc. directly in your Markdown code. Pretty handy, right?

Currently, only the core library of the framework, which is capable
of rendering Markdown into a hierarchy of Vue components, is usable.

I, and anybody willing to contribute, will be working on expanding the
framework.

There are plans to create a Directus extension in order
to edit the source Markdown with a live preview, a library of commonly
used and highly refined components and a PDF renderer along the Vue one.

The text you're reading right now was rendered using Hermes. You've been
reading the proof of concept. Pretty cool, right?
